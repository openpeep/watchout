- [x] Open Source | `MIT` license

## Installing
```
nimble install watchout
```

## Examples

Quick example using Watchout as a standalone binary app
_todo_

In Nim language

```nim
import watchout
from std/os import execShellCmd
from std/strutils import `%`

proc yelling() =
    proc watchoutCallback(file: FileObject) {.gcsafe, closure.} =
        discard execShellCmd("clear")                           # TODO Watchout for "cleanScreen"
        echo "‚ú® Watchout is yelling for changes..."
        echo "\"$1\" has been updated" % [file.getName()]
    
    var monitor = Watchout.init()
    monitor.addFile("sample.txt", watchoutCallback)
    monitor.start(ms = 400)

when isMainModule:
    yelling()
```

### üëë Discover Nim language
<strong>What's Nim?</strong> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/)

<strong>Why Nim?</strong> Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. We want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to our intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2022.
